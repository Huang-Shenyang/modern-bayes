Today's agenda: A review of \texttt{R}, getting used to R markdown, vectors, matrices, scatterplots, and functions. 

***Lab Tasks***


1. Store three vectors using \textsf{rnorm()} of length $n = 100$ as \textsf{Var1}, \textsf{Var2}, and \textsf{Var3}.


2. List all the items currently in the environment.


3. Store \textsf{Var1} in a $10 \times 10$ matrix. Call this \textsf{myMatrix}.


4. Create a scatterplot of \textsf{Var1} vs. \textsf{Var2}. On the same plotting window include histograms of \textsf{Var1} and \textsf{Var2}.


5. Write a function that takes as its inputs, $p = 2$, $n$-dimensional vectors and a vector of length $p$ containing the names of these vectors. Your function combine these two vectors into a \textsf{data.frame()}, get the row-wise maximum and store this in a new vector. Finally produce a box-plot of this vector, store it as a separate .pdf, and return the mean value of this vector.
